## Overview

This is the result of my first Frontend Mentor project. 

The main goal of it was to recreate a qr-code component based on design files and assets in both Desktop and Mobile versions. 

In order to do it, I was working mainly in HTML and CSS and was using the Tailwindcss Frontend classes and framework to speed up the process and use their utility classes.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Tailwindcss Framework

### What I learned

This exercice was for me the perfect oportunity to work again on the Tailwindcss framework and to really try to reproduce a design from a design file only using html and css. 

### Continued development

For the future, I would like to keep learning how to use front-end framework like Tailwindcss and get better at using good html components. 

This project was also the oportunity for me to learn and use Git and GitHub. 

### Useful resources
